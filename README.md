# 🍎 NutriClass - Food Classification Using Nutritional Data

A machine learning project that classifies food into categories based on nutritional values like Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbs, and Sugar.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In the era of increasing dietary awareness, accurately classifying food based on nutritional content has become crucial for health tracking, diet planning, and food recommendation systems.  
The challenge is to build a **multi-class classification machine learning model** that can categorize food items into different groups (e.g., snacks, fruits, dairy, etc.) based on their **nutritional attributes** such as **calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar**.  
This model can serve as the foundation for **smart dietary applications**, **nutrition monitoring tools**, and **educational platforms**, enabling automated and intelligent food categorization.

## 📌 Tech Stack
